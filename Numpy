NumPy is a Python library for fast numerical operations on large arrays and matrices.

ndarray is the core data structure in NumPy, representing n-dimensional arrays.

array() creates a NumPy array from a Python list or tuple.

arange() creates arrays with evenly spaced values (like range() but for arrays).

linspace() creates arrays with a specified number of values between two points.

reshape() changes the shape of an array without changing its data.

dtype shows or sets the data type of array elements.

shape returns the dimensions (rows, columns, etc.) of an array.

size gives the total number of elements in an array.

ndim gives the number of dimensions of an array.

zeros() creates an array filled with zeros.

ones() creates an array filled with ones.

eye() creates an identity matrix (diagonal 1s, rest 0s).

sum(), mean(), std() compute basic stats across array elements.

axis parameter allows operations (like sum or mean) across rows or columns.

random.rand() generates random numbers in a given shape.

array slicing works like lists (arr[1:4], arr[:, 0], etc.).

broadcasting allows arithmetic between arrays of different shapes.

vectorization speeds up operations by avoiding Python loops.

np.dot() and np.matmul() perform matrix multiplication.
